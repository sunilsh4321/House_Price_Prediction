# House_Price_Prediction
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates to assist real estate stakeholders in making informed decisions.

**Tech Stack Used**
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Data Processing and Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Project Overview**
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to estimate the prices of houses. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms, we strive to create a model that can accurately predict house prices based on historical data and relevant features. This tool can be invaluable for real estate agents, buyers, sellers, and investors looking to make informed decisions.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Analyzed the distribution of various features and their correlation with house prices.
Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to identify trends and patterns.

**Model Development**
Linear Regression: Implemented as a baseline model to establish a performance benchmark.
Decision Tree: Used to capture non-linear relationships between features and target variable.
Random Forest: Applied to improve accuracy and generalize better by combining multiple decision trees.

**Model Evaluation**
Evaluated models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Compared the performance of different models to select the best one for deployment.

**Results**
Provided detailed results of model performance, including visualizations of predicted vs. actual house prices.
Highlighted the best-performing model and discussed its implications.
