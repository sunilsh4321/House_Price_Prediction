# House_Price_Prediction
Our objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices using a set of features that describe properties in Boston. We'll leverage scikit-learn's Boston dataset, which consists of 506 rows representing various towns or suburbs. Each row contains 13 attributes (features), along with a target column indicating the price of the houses.

Below are the libraries and packages used in this Machine Learning model building:-
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. SKLearn
